Delivery Plan
=============

This page describes the Delivery Plan for the project. 

The plan calls for an overall architecture design, which is executed in stages (mini-sprints, essentially). Each stage focuses on one component, with the overall plan ensuring each part fits together.

In this plan, there are three stages: This is because I would expect to be able to achieve each of these stages in roughly a day, once up to speed in a role.

Milestones
----------

1. Requirements restated
1. Architectural design
1. Staged Delivery:
    1. Foundations: Infrastructure, Database, View
    1. Critical view: Admin side, tables, graphs, visualizations
    1. Survey view: 5 steps, next & previous, Ajax
1. Demonstration

Risks & Mitigation
------------------

1. _Failure_to_meet_expectations_ for deliverables may result in solution which is not usable. This will be mitigated by frequent reviews of plans and code to ensure the final deliverables meet or exceed expectations.
1. _Unexpected_factors_in_first_time_components_ (namely API Star) may introduce delays to resolve. This will be mitigated by ensuring that the number of first-time components is as low as possible, and ... 
1. A.N. Other?
