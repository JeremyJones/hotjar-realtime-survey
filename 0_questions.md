Possible Questions
==================

### MOBILE

The UI says 'an HTML page' so I'm not 100% clear about mobile-friendly, but presumably the page should be responsive and usable in any reasonable device/environment.

### FRAMEWORK 

API Star- definitely ok to use a framework like this rather than writing more Python from scratch?

### And finally

Thank you.
