Possible Questions
==================

### Mobile

The UI says 'an HTML page' so I'm not 100% clear about mobile-friendly, but presumably the page should be responsive and usable in any reasonable device/environment.

### "Average"

Any specific average required or just all three?

> We use three different types of average in maths: the mean, the mode and the median, each of which describes a different 'normal' value. The mean is what you get if you share everything equally, the mode is the most common value, and the median is the value in the middle of a set of data.
