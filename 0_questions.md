Possible Questions
==================

### The requirements state that 'Address' should be a text input, i.e. single line. Is that a fixed requirement? (I would suggest 2-3 lines for a semi-structured address, stored separately.)

### The Favourite Colours requirement says it should be a checkbox group, presumably with checkboxes beside a number of colours, rather than e.g. open a colour wheel or other full palette. Are there a list of specific colours or options to be used? (I'll use a selection of a few random primary colours if not.)

### The UI says 'an HTML page' so I'm not 100% clear about mobile-friendly, but presumably the page should be responsive and usable in any reasonable device/environment.

### It's definitely ok to use a Python framework, i.e. APIStar? The overall codebase delivered seems likely to be Javascript largely, and then a little bit of everything else.
