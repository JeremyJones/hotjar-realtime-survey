Questions for Hotjar
====================

### On the admin page requirements, it says that the table of responses should contain 8 columns, plus another column for flagging completed surveys. If it's ok, other information will be available to be displayed, such as time/date of submission, user IP address, etc.. I'll plan to hide those columns initially if that's ok.

### Should the system guard against 'new' responses which contain some duplicate information, such as the same name or email address? (I think yes; or it should be a configurable attribute for each question.)

### On the age select, are there predefined options I should use? (Or I'll do range(13,100))

### The requirements state that 'Address' should be a text input, i.e. single line. Is that a fixed requirement? (I would suggest 2-3 lines for a semi-structured address, stored separately.)

### The Favourite Colours requirement says it should be a checkbox group, presumably with checkboxes beside a number of colours, rather than e.g. open a colour wheel or other full palette. Are there a list of specific colours or options to be used? (I'll use a selection of a few random primary colours if not.)
