Running in Production
Running a WSGIApp project
For WSGI applications, the recommended production deployment is Gunicorn, using the Meinheld worker.

$ pip install gunicorn
$ pip install meinheld
$ gunicorn app:app --workers=4 --bind=0.0.0.0:5000 --pid=pid --worker-class=meinheld.gmeinheld.MeinheldWorker
Typically you'll want to run as many workers as you have CPU cores on the server.
